Numerical-Integration-Error-Analysis
====================================

Final research paper for 21-660 Numerical Analysis, Fall 2014. This paper investigates some use cases of applying several numerical quadrature methods (namely, Newton-Cotes, Gaussian quadrature, and periodic quadrature) for approximating the values of definite integrals, compares them in terms of their degrees of accuracy, and does some analysis/interpretation of the results.
